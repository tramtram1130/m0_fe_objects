# Self Evaluation

- What did you struggle with in this section?

Sometimes I catch myself typing too fast and end up mistyping the syntax so I just need to take my time.

- How is note-taking going? What are you finding helpful? When do you find yourself taking the most helpful notes?

Note taking is going and it's been helping me a lot. I notice that I retain concepts and obscure rules better when I write it down.

- What are you noticing that you lean into - Googling, or trying to solve a problem in code on your own first?

I attempt to solve it myself first before Googling.
